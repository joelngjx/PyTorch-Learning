# PyTorch-Learning
This is a simple repository of experimentation files I have uploaded while self-learning PyTorch, which includes:
* gaussian_noise.py -> A manual implementation of including Gaussian noise for simple Linear Regression
* mnist_PT.py -> Tackling the classic MNIST dataset through PyTorch with the application of:
   - batch size training & testing
   - usage of evaluation metrics via torchmetrics (accuracy, precision, recall, f1score) from the `metrics_functions.py` file
   - visualisation of precision-recall curves
